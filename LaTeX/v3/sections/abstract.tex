We revisit the 1997 PayWord credit-based micropayment scheme from Rivest and Shamir. We observe that smart contracts can be used to augment this system, apply to `claim or refund' paradigm of cryptocurrencies to remove the counter-party risk inherent in PayWorld, and use a smart contract to `staple' real value (in Ether) to payments in the system. Our implementation is more concise than any Ethereum payment channel we are aware of and the offline payments are very compact values (264 bits). The main drawback of \ew is the moderate gas price of using the system, \$7, which prices it out of the micropayments use-case. Despite this, we see value in exploring alternatives to Ethereum's internal payment system: \ew works offline and is cheaper when more than \textblue{20} payments between the same participants are made.
