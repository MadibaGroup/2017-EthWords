	Abstract = {Bitcoin as deployed today does not scale. Scalability research has focused on two directions: (1) redesigning the Blockchain protocol, and (2) facilitating `off-chain transactions' and only consulting the Blockchain if an adjudicator is required. In this paper we focus on the latter and provide an overview of Bitcoin payment networks. These consist of two components: payment channels to facilitate off-chain transactions between two parties, and the capability to fairly exchange bitcoins across multiple channels. We compare Duplex Micropayment Channels and Lightning Channels, before discussing Hashed Time-Locked Contracts which enable Bitcoin-based payment networks. Finally, we highlight challenges for route discovery in these networks.},

@inproceedings{JaOd97,
	Abstract = {Existing software proposals for electronic payments can be divided into ``on-line'' schemes that require participation of a trusted party (the bank) in every transaction and are secure against overspending, and the ``off-line'' schemes that do not require a third party and guarantee only that overspending is detected when vendors submit their transaction records to the bank (usually at the end of the day). We propose a new hybrid scheme that combines the advantages of both of the above traditional design strategies. It allows for control of overspending at a cost of only a modest increase in communication compared to the off-line schemes. Our protocol is based on probabilistic polling. During each transaction, with some small probability, the vendor forwards information about this transaction to the bank. This enables the bank to maintain an accurate approximation of a customer's spending. The frequency of polling messages is related to the monetary value of transactions and the amount of overspending the bank is willing to risk.},
